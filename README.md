### Section 1 - (5 mins)

#### 1. Explain the difference between an abstract class and an interface.

Abstract class is a class that can't be instantiated like other classes but it can be extended to another class. Also, abstract methods and properties declared in the abstract class must be defined in the inherited class. Interface is also can't be instantiated, but it is more like a type implementation for the classes. Abstract class properties and methods require the 'abstract' keyword to make it abstract while inheriting. But in the interface, all the properties and methods have a default abstract behavior and must be defined in the child class.
